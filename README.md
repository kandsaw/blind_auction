# Silent Auction Bidding Program

This is a simple Python program that simulates a silent auction, where multiple users can place bids, and the highest bidder wins.

## Features
- Allows multiple users to place bids.
- Determines the highest bidder.
- Uses a loop to continue accepting bids until the user decides to stop.
- Clears the screen between bids to keep the auction private.

## How It Works
1. The program starts by displaying a logo from the `art` module.
2. Users are prompted to enter their name and bid amount.
3. The program stores all bids in a dictionary.
4. After all bids are collected, it determines the highest bidder and displays the winner.

## Usage
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter your name and bid when prompted.
3. Continue adding bids until all bidders have entered their bids.
4. The program will announce the highest bidder.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `art` module (ensure it's installed using `pip install art`)
